# 📄 Bangla Speech Recognition -- Open-Ended Lab Report (EEE 309, Summer 2025)

This repository contains the **lab manual and post-lab report** for our
open-ended design project on **Bangla Speech Recognition**.

## 📌 Project Overview

We investigated and developed a simple Bangla speech recognition system
capable of distinguishing between two words --- **"সত্য" (True)** and
**"মিথ্যা" (False)** --- using **cross-correlation--based feature
matching**. The system is designed to be **speaker-independent** and
applicable to touch-free control applications such as voice-activated
devices, assistive technologies, and secure authentication systems.

## 📂 Contents

-   📘 **Lab Manual** -- Objectives, theory, literature review,
    methodology, flowchart, and system design\
-   📊 **Post-Lab Report** -- Motivation, technique selection &
    justification, results with plots (waveforms, cross-correlation),
    observations, and learning outcomes\
-   🖼️ **Figures** -- Waveform and cross-correlation plots for Bangla
    words (*সত্য*, *মিথ্যা*)\
-   💻 **MATLAB Code** -- Scripts for audio preprocessing,
    normalization, and cross-correlation-based recognition

## ✅ Key Results

-   Recognition accuracy: **72.22%** on test samples\
-   Demonstrated effectiveness of cross-correlation in distinguishing
    between two Bangla commands\
-   Identified limitations: noise sensitivity, speaker variation, and
    scalability challenges\
-   Future improvements: use of **MFCC/LPC features** and **machine
    learning models (SVM, DNN)** for higher accuracy and robustness
